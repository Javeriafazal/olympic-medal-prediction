# Olympic Medals Prediction using Machine Learning

This is my first machine learning project!  
It predicts the number of medals a country will win based on features like the number of athletes and previous medal counts.

## What I did
- Loaded and cleaned the data (`teams.csv`)
- Explored relationships using correlation and visualizations
- Built a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated predictions and visualized results

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Run all cells to reproduce results
